2. Parse constellation line patterns from GeoJSON format
3. Transform astronomical coordinates (RA/Dec) to screen pixels
4. Apply equirectangular projection for full-sky mapping
5. Render with spectral color mapping and magnitude scaling

**Natural Language Processing:**
- Custom tokenization and entity recognition system

## üåç What Is the Intended Impact?

### Primary Impact: Democratizing Astronomy

**Problem Addressed:**  
Astronomical data is abundant but often locked behind complex software, academic jargon, or expensive tools. Most people interested in astronomy feel excluded by the technical barriers.

**Our Solution:**  
Make exploring the cosmos as easy as asking a question or hovering over a star. No PhD required, no manual to read‚Äîjust instant, beautiful access to the night sky.

### Secondary Impacts:

1. **Educational Access**
   - Students worldwide can explore astronomical data for free
   - Teachers can use it as an interactive classroom tool
   - Self-learners can satisfy curiosity without textbooks

2. **Inspiring Scientific Interest**
   - Beautiful visualizations spark wonder and curiosity
   - Interactive exploration encourages deeper learning
   - Accessible entry point to broader STEM fields

3. **Data Literacy**
   - Demonstrates how large datasets can be made comprehensible
   - Shows that visualization is key to understanding complexity
   - Encourages critical thinking about data representation

4. **Open Science**
   - Code is open-source for others to learn from
   - Transparent about methods and data sources
   - Reproducible and extensible by the community

### Long-Term Vision:

Stellar Cartography proves that massive space datasets don't have to be intimidating. If we can make 9,000+ stars accessible through natural language and intuitive design, we can apply the same principles to:
- Exoplanet databases
- Deep sky objects
- Satellite tracking
- Mars rover data
- Solar system exploration

**The bigger picture:** Technology should be a bridge to knowledge, not a barrier.
