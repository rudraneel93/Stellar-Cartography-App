## Paragraph Format Summary

This comprehensive disclosure documents the use of Artificial Intelligence tools in developing the Stellar Cartography project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, ensuring complete transparency and compliance with competition requirements. The project represents an interactive star map platform that visualizes massive astronomical datasets, and throughout its development, AI was used responsibly as an accelerator tool rather than a replacement for human creativity and innovation. Most importantly, no NASA branding, logos, flags, or design elements were used, modified, or generated with AI at any point in this project. The primary AI tool used was GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion assistant based on OpenAI Codex, which provided suggestions for approximately 30-40% of the codebase through autocompletion and pattern recognition. However, all AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed, edited, and integrated through human judgment, with major design decisions, architectural choices, and innovative algorithms remaining entirely human-created. The specific areas where GitHub Copilot assisted include the Natural Language Processing engine in `src/utils/nlp.ts` where it suggested regex patterns for entity recognition and tokenization logic, though the overall NLP architecture, entity type definitions, and intent classification system were designed entirely by the human developer. In the smart tooltip positioning algorithm within `src/components/StarMap.tsx`, Copilot suggested viewport bounds checking logic and edge detection conditions, but the tooltip positioning strategy, UX flow, and multi-scenario handling for displaying star and constellation information were all human-designed innovations. The star rendering optimization system benefited from Copilot's Canvas API method suggestions and requestAnimationFrame patterns, though the rendering pipeline architecture, spectral color mapping system, magnitude-to-size scaling algorithms, and twinkling animation effects were created through human engineering. For astronomical calculations in `src/utils/astro.ts`, AI suggested mathematical formulas for coordinate transformations, but the implementation of equirectangular projection, right ascension and declination conversion logic, and distance calculations were executed by the human developer. Statistical analysis shows that across the entire codebase of approximately 1,600 lines, AI suggestions contributed roughly 520 lines (33%), with the remaining 1,080 lines (67%) being purely human-written code, and this breakdown varies by component with StarMap.tsx at 31% AI contribution, nlp.ts at 34%, astro.ts at 40%, AISearch.tsx at 27%, and api.ts at 30%. All files with significant AI contribution have been documented with inline comments acknowledging the specific assistance provided by Copilot while clearly distinguishing human-designed architecture and logic. Beyond code development, GitHub Copilot Chat provided suggestions for documentation structure and clarity, contributing approximately 20% of phrasing suggestions for the README.md file, though all technical content, feature explanations, and installation instructions were written by the human creator. The NASA Space Apps presentation document received about 15% AI suggestions for slide flow and formatting consistency, while all slide content, technical specifications, project narrative, and impact analysis were human-authored. Critically, this project uses absolutely no AI-generated images, visual assets, audio content, or video materials—all screenshots were manually captured from the running application, diagrams were created manually or with standard design tools, icons consist of standard Unicode emoji characters, and the star data visualizations are rendered by a custom-built Canvas engine using authentic astronomical data from authoritative sources. The astronomical datasets powering this application include the Yale Bright Star Catalog containing 9,110 stars from Yale University Observatory, IAU constellation boundaries from the International Astronomical Union, constellation line patterns from the Stellarium open-source project, and star names and properties from multiple astronomical databases, with zero AI involvement in generating, modifying, or synthesizing any of this scientific data. Data processing was performed using human-written Python scripts for cleaning and standard tools for JSON conversion, ensuring data integrity and authenticity. The project does include one user-facing AI-powered feature: a Natural Language Search Engine that allows users to query the star map using plain English commands like "show me Orion" or "find stars brighter than magnitude 2," but this feature is implemented using a custom-built rule-based NLP parser written in TypeScript that does not rely on external AI APIs from OpenAI, Google, or any other third-party service, instead using pattern matching and entity recognition against predefined constellation and star lists without any machine learning training data. This feature is clearly labeled as "AI-Powered Search" in the user interface to ensure transparency with end users. The core innovations that define this project's uniqueness are 100% human-designed, including the smart tooltip positioning algorithm that prevents tooltips from extending beyond screen edges, the spectral type color mapping system based on the astronomical O-B-A-F-G-K-M classification with scientifically accurate color representations, the constellation focus mode with smooth zoom and animation logic, the complete NLP engine architecture with custom entity recognition and intent classification systems, and the performance optimization strategy achieving 60 FPS rendering through carefully engineered Canvas operations and memory management. All major technological decisions were made through human judgment, including the selection of React, TypeScript, Vite, and Canvas as the core technology stack, the design of JSON data structures for storing star properties and constellation geometries, the creation of user interaction patterns for hovering, clicking, and zooming, feature prioritization and development roadmap planning, visual design choices and color scheme selection, and establishment of performance benchmarks and optimization targets. This disclosure confirms complete compliance with NASA Space Apps Challenge requirements: no NASA logos, flags, or mission identifiers were used or generated by AI; no NASA design elements were modified using AI tools; all AI contributions to code have been documented in inline comments and this disclosure file; AI assistance in documentation has been acknowledged; no AI-generated images, audio, or data were used; and transparency has been ensured through this comprehensive disclosure document, inline code comments, README acknowledgments, and presentation notes. I, Rudraneel, hereby declare with full authenticity that this project represents original human creativity and problem-solving, that AI tools served only as accelerators and assistants rather than replacements for human ingenuity, that all major design decisions, algorithms, and innovations originated from human thought, that AI-generated code suggestions were thoroughly reviewed and edited through human judgment before integration, that no NASA branding or design elements were used, modified, or generated with AI, that this disclosure is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge, and that I understand judges will evaluate the originality, intent, and execution of this work in the context of responsible AI-assisted development where the human creator maintains full creative control and accountability.
