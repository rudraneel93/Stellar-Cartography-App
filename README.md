# Live Star Map

This project is a modern React + Vite web app that displays a real-time, generative night sky. It uses browser geolocation to get your current location, fetches star, constellation, and deep sky object data from a free API (such as Stellarium Web API), and renders a beautiful, interactive sky that updates with the current time and location.

## Features
- Real-time star positions
- Constellations and deep sky objects
- Modern, performant UI (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- Canvas/WebGL rendering

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to the local address shown in the terminal.

## Customization
- Replace the API integration or rendering logic as needed for your use case.
